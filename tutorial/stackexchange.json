As part of my degree, I am required to complete a number of co-ops/internships.  I have completed one summer internship and am in the middle of an 8-month internship at a separate company (both software engineering roles).\nWhile these have started out as exciting opportunities to get \"real world\" experience, both internships eventually devolved into mostly unfulfilling work that make me question my career choice as a whole.\nMy biggest grievances with these experiences have been the following:\n\nUnsatisfying workload: The amount of work I have been assigned is often way less than what I am capable of handling.  My managers always praise the pace and quality of my work, but there has simply not been enough to keep me occupied and engaged. Addressing this with comments such as \"I feel like I could be taking on more responsibility\" has not resulted with much change.\nNo collaboration: I have been the sole developer on all of the projects I have been assigned.  While having a high degree of freedom is nice, I feel like it has limited my early career learning and growth.  Not having the opportunity to collaborate with other coworkers or pick the brains of more senior developers has limited me to doing only what I am capable of teaching myself.\nLittle constructive criticism: Being an undergrad student with less than one year of work experience, I fully understand that I have a lot to learn when it comes to my skills as a developer and overall employee.  However, I feel that I don't receive the criticism necessary to make these improvements.  Code reviews have ranged from non-existent to very informal, and directly asking for ways I can improve has not been fruitful.\n\nWhile there have been moments where these internships have felt challenging and rewarding, I'd say the grievances listed above have caused them to feel unfulfilling a majority of the time.  I do enjoy the technical challenge that programming provides, but not enough to justify dealing with these issues.\nAre these just unfortunate experiences that don't reflect the software industry as a whole?  If so, how can I make the most of my time to hopefully secure a better opportunity in the future?\nIf this is actually reflective of life in the software industry, do I need to do some soul searching when it comes to my career path?\n"},

This suggests unmetered \"free time\".\nA tempo indication of \"Lent\" (AKA Lento/Slow) is also provided, and text (in french) also gives some rather obscure expression instructions.\nHere is the first line of No. 1:\n\nLooking at the music, and in several recordings I have heard, the bass line and chords definitely look and sound like they provide undeniable (yet somewhat syncopated) beats. There is a repetitive pattern that I would describe as: being in a 2/2 meter, with the bass notes on 1, and the chords on the-and-of-1, and the-and-of-2. (Or if you prefer 4/4, the chords on beats 2 and 4.)\nBut this contradicts the idea of \"free time\", and doesn't explain the lack of time signature and bar lines.\nAdmittedly a significant amount of rubato is applied by the various performers (and it does suit this piece). But rubato only affects the tempo, not the meter right?\n\nAre the Gnossiennes really in \"free time\"?\nIs there some other reason that the time signature and bar lines are absent?\nDoes omitting the time signature and bar lines make it easier or harder to perform this piece?\n\n"},

I'll reproduce the relevant discussion here:\n\nAt first sight, magnetic monopoles seem to be incompatible with\nquantum mechanics. This is because, in quantum mechanics,\nelectromagnetic fields have to be described in terms of a scalar\npotential $\\phi$ and vector potential, $\\vec{B} = \\nabla \\times \\vec{A}$, and it\nfollows [that] the field must then be sourceless, $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{B} = 0$\n\nIt's clear, of course, that if $\\vec{B} = \\nabla \\times \\vec{A}$, then $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{B} = 0$. I don't understand, however, what quantum mechanics has to do with any of this.\nUnder classical electrodynamics, the magnetic vector potential is defined to be that whose curl gives the magnetic field. Together with electric potential $\\phi$, we may specify the electric field.\nIt is stated earlier in the article that magnetic monopoles are compatible with classical electrodynamics. It goes on to suggest that they are (seemingly) incompatible with quantum mechanics, but then argues this using what seems to be classical electrodynamics.\nHow is this related to QM?\n"},

I am currently going through the CISCO Networking Essentials course, and one of the Activities in the second module left me confused. Basically computers with MAC addresses 0E and 0F are both connected to a hub, which connects to a single Layer 2 switch port (Fa9). The question starts with the assumption that a MAC address table entry already exists for 0E (Fa9) but none yet for 0F. If computer with MAC 0E were to address a frame to computer with MAC 0F, how would that ever reach its destination? As I understand it, the switch, not \"seeing\" 0F in its table would flood the frame out all connected ports except Fa9 (incoming), but that means the frame will never exit via Fa9, so how is computer with MAC 0F ever supposed to receive the frame?\nThanks in advance for your help.\n"},

In essence it's paying a premium to lower risk. A large company can pool risk, so it doesn't feel the effects of a small number of i.e. houses being burned down by a wildfire in California.\nFrom this link, it's very common for dental insurance to have quite low annual maximum benefits in the $1000 range, in addition to a lifetime maximum. But major dental procedures with surgery can cost much more. The companies are very large risk pools, so they only care about average cost like most insurance companies. This means the only reason they impose benefit limits is because not doing so would significantly add to the average cost. Thus, a substantial fraction of dollars spent are spent beyond this limit.\nThis leaves two questions:\n\nWhy are companies passing on so much risk to individuals, when they don't do so for other types of insurance such as houses that can cost upwards of a million?\nWhy pay for insurance in first place if it can't protect you from the risk of very expensive procedures?\n\n"},

Without asking about interrupting, saying hello etc, he just says quite agressively \"you find me some people to work for the DEFCON 3\". I'm like, what, and I tell him that they'll join the work on it if they want to work on it. He replies that since it's DEFCON3 it's mandatory that some people work on it. I tell him ok, I'm in the middle of my 1-1 meeting, we'll discuss this later. Then he refuses to leave telling me that DEFCON3 \"trumps\" 1-1 meeting and it's more important, visibly quite annoyed/agitated. After telling him several times that I'll finish my 1-1 and that I'll see afterwards, he leaves but quite angrily.\nAfterwards, I was at lunch with other coworkers, around 10 or so. The same manager comes in in front the tables, and stars shouting angrily \"When I ask for people for DEFCON3, I ask for people for DEFCON3! It's not optional to come and help\". People were quite surprised / annoyed at this behavior especially during lunch pause.\nThis manager isn't even in my reporting line, nor is he \"officially\" the person that evens manage this DEFCON3 thing, so I dont even think he has any authority to request people to work with him for no real reason.\nWhat do you think I should do in this situation ?

Pune, India: Deshmukh & Company.\n\nfor\n\n\u0926\u093e\u092e\u0932\u0947, \u092e\u094b. \u0915\u0947 1970 \u0936\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092f \u092e\u0930\u093e\u0920\u0940 \u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0915\u0930\u0923 [A scientific grammar of Marathi]. \u0915\u0943. \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940. \u0905\u0930\u094d\u091c\u0941\u0928\u0935\u093e\u0921\u0915\u0930. Pune, India: Deshmukh & Company.\n\nI personally don't like this practice. Here's why.\n\nIt's not about the pronunciation at all. If it really was, people would have got uncomfortable with Jean, a French name too as it should have been John as per the English conventions. I always used to mispronounce it as jeen from jeans without the s ([\u02a4i\u02d0n] in IPA). This clearly means that people are just not happy to see a script other than Latin in academic writing which I feel is very unjust in a multicultural and multilingual world.\nIf I am citing a work in a language other than English anyways the reader will have to read it in that language. If they don't know the language, they will probably need a translator for accessing the work. So anyways just transliterating the title is not going to help them in any ways.\nIf a reader knows that particular language, then it is even annoying for them because there is no \"universal\" transliteration scheme available. Different researchers follow different conventions without even giving the rules for parsing them. It obstructs the reading of the person who is actually able to read it without any aid and comprehend the language in which the source is written on the cost of the so called \"comfort/convenience\" of a person who is not able to (or probably going to) read the actual source.\n\nCan we just start getting comfortable with scripts other than Latin in the bibliography?\n"},

Sorry about that.\nI run a startup where all fulltime employees also have an equity stake (with vesting and a 1 year cliff). One of the engineers we (I) brought on board around a months back is not really (at all) working out. His interviews and live coding sessions were fine. We are all remote (~30% could be onsite but now we chose to be fully remote).\nThe company is exploring a new photo application. Design has started working on the initial stages (user research, user stories, etc.). Simultaneously we wanted to test the feasibility of doing some advanced things like filters, overlays, etc.\nSo the idea was while the designers would work the preliminary sketches, engineering would do a feasibility study of some of the more advanced features. In order to start with these advanced features, the first step is obviously a simple photo capture / display app.\nThe engineer in question was tasked with this. In one on one calls, as well as in group sessions, he communicated that the simple image capture / display is done and he had started working on the more advanced things. This is the first task he has been given as the new engineer on the team.\nI asked for a code review session to see his progress. During this, I discovered that even simple image capture or display wasn't working right. Later I found out (and he agreed) that he essentially copied the code of a purportedly full fledged photo app from another repository on github. This in itself (reusing code) is normal but what was shocking was that none of it actually worked. It was obvious he did not even test any of it before declaring that he was done.\nI consider this a serious breach of trust. In principle, this is also a matter of competence, but in practice, getting a simple image app up and running is actually very straightforward - there are many ready to use components. He chose not to use the components and put together the app himself, but just to clone a pre-made entire app. And he didn't test it. This to me indicates supreme negligence, laziness and carelessness.\nDuring the code review he mentioned he did not do anything because the designs were not ready and that he'd start once they were. This is in direct contraction to earlier understandings and agreements.\nI think I should fire him summarily because it is only been a month.\nQuestions around this -\n\nWhat and how much should I communicate in the firing message? Should I have a conversation first and try to work things out (and risk more excuses and problems at a later stage)?\n\nWhat should I communicate to the small (around 5-6 people) engineering team? Asking them to use/test the app he uploaded will suffice because they are all engineers. Or should I just say he left due to personal/whatever reasons? Or that I fired him due to lack of commitment / breach of trust?\n\nIn terms of \"experience\", I am around the middle and I run engineering. There are some very senior engineers and a very junior guy. Would it make sense to have a semi-consultative session with the senior engineer? What do I tell the junior who expected to be working under the guy I want to fire?\n\n\n"},

I think it was a side story from a bigger space opera series I never read, but it stands alone.\nThere was a interplanetary mining(?) vessel, the kind where a crew spend years away from home for big pay on return. There were quite a few men aboard and they had next to nothing to do on their down-time.\nOne of the guys was gambler and maybe a card-sharp. He would play any game, bet on anything and always won. As a result he had finagled most of the crew out of all the pay they were owed at the end of the job. Everyone was disgruntled about this.\nThe cook was an old hand from a poor, broken-down and obscure little colony. He never lost an opportunity to mention his home planet (I'll call it X) and praise it up. This made the men laugh because they knew he came from a real jerkwater planet.\nAt the end of the contract they were on their way back to their home system when the ship was contacted by an intergalactic diplomat needing a ride. They diverted and picked him up.\nThe diplomat was from a different Vulcan-like race, emotionally controlled and incapable of lying. This was why they were employed in interplanetary relations, trade negotiations and so on.\nSo the cook whipped up a celebratory dinner for their august guest and it was soon evident that the alien was haughty and exceptionally proud. The men took turns quizzing him about where he'd been and it seemed he'd been everywhere and knew the culture of every place. They asked his opinion on various subjects and he always replied truthfully, unable to lie.\nUnlike the rest, the cook had hung on to some of his money. Sensing a way to get his hands on it all, the gambler suggested asking the visitor about X, sure that he would show the cook up. Fiercely loyal, the cook accepted the bet, all his remaining pay against all the gambler's winnings.\nSo the gambler asked the visitor if he was familiar with the cook's people. He replied indeed he had been to their planet. The next question was how would he describe X.\nThe visitor grinned and stated without any shadow of a doubt X was the most wonderful place in the galaxy.\nThe gambler and the rest of the men were dumbstruck, but they couldn't argue, the authority had spoken. And the gambler was forced to hand over all his winnings, which the cook returned to the rest.\nSo how had the cook won the bet?\nWell, in the old cook's native language, which he knew the interplanetary diplomat was familiar with...\n\n ...X means HOME.\n\nNow I'm sure that although the setting is original the story sounds like an old one. It's got an Arabian Nights tale ring to it. So there may be alternates but I'm wondering which space opera series this version may have belonged to.\n"},

{"title": "What is meant, exactly, by nonrepeating when talking about irrational numbers?", "tag": ["elementary-number-theory", "recreational-mathematics", "math-history", "irrational-numbers"], "author": "Numerical Disintegration", "link": "https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4435375/what-is-meant-exactly-by-nonrepeating-when-talking-about-irrational-numbers", "content": "\nMy question is referring to the exact definition mathematicians use when describing the decimal expansions of irrational numbers as \"nonterminating and nonrepeating.\" Now, I understand, at least ostensibly, what is meant by \"nonterminating\" and the phrase \"nonrepeating\" seems simple enough to understand, but I've always wondered what is meant by the exact definition:\nIt was always my understanding that the term \"nonrepeating\" was referring to a specific sequence of numbers showing up no more than once in the decimal expansion. I'm confused as to the exact criteria for fulfilling this requirement.\n\nSurely it can't be just a sequence of $1$ number. In the sense that $\\pi$ starts with the number $3$ and then the number $3$ shows up again, and again and again an infinite number of times.\n\nIs it a sequence of $2$ numbers repeating then? For instance in the golden ratio $\\phi = 1.61803398874989$ we could take any $2$ number sequence, say $61$ or $98$ or $33$ and would it be sufficient to say that that particular sequence never shows up again? That seems highly unlikely given the \"nonterminating\" nature of the decimal expansions for irrational numbers.\n\nIf not, then what sequence of $n$ numbers is sufficient to declare a number \"nonrepeating?\"\n\nMoreover, philosophically, how does it make sense that any sequence of numbers doesn't show up more than once? When, necessarily, an irrational number has an infinitely long decimal expansion and a sequence of numbers (at least for practical determination) would be finite up to some $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$\n\nI mean, the idea that the sequence length be infinitely long just seems like a convenient workaround that dilutes the significance of the \"nonrepeating\" quality of irrational numbers in the first place. Since, if you ever came upon a sequence that repeated for whatever $n$-digit sequence you had you could always just say \"oh actually I meant this $(n+1)$-digit sequence instead!\" and keep adding digits to the sequence ad infinitum.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the term isn't referring to repeating sequences of numbers but rather the same numbers repeating one after another.\n\nBut this cannot be the case as we saw above with the Golden Ratio, in the short approximation written out we have $2$ cases where the same number is repeated immediately (i.e., $33$ and $88$) we also see this in this approximation for $\\pi = 3.1415926535897932384626433$\n\nSo, if the term \"nonrepeating\" doesn't refer to repetition of sequences of numbers $n$ digits long, nor does it the consecutive repetition of the same number, then what else would it refer to?\n"},
