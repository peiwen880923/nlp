You're essentially working two jobs, one of which is highly dangerous and doesn't even pay. So naturally, a lot of them would have a great deal of motivation to make their dayjob as high-pay, low-stress, and low-hours as they can make it, so they can put more of their energy into their herowork without running themselves ragged.\nOne option they have is to use the cards they've been dealt to their advantage and try to use their superpowers to get a job they can do way better, and way more easily, than any ordinary human. Let's say we're working with pretty basic, cookie-cutter superpowers here: someone who is significantly stronger, faster and tougher than any normal human could be. But the problem is that they still need to keep their powers a secret, so they can't, say, be seen on a construction site casually lifting a massive I-beam over one shoulder. At first blush, this seems like that dashes their options of using their superpowers to their advantage to make their dayjob easier and more lucrative. But does it?\nWhat sort of job could a superhuman be more productive than a human at, with less effort, without having to reveal to anyone that they are in fact a superhuman?\n"},

And since the first two vampires came into existence in the area that is now known as Romania in around 1450, a question I need to have a solid answer for is when, exactly, they came to America, and more to the point, when that would have been physically possible.\nSea travel is a bit of an issue for vampires, you see, for two very important reasons:\n1: While the strongest of them can do things like fly, manipulate the weather and control human minds, they have a weakness to both the sun and open water. The celestial energies Earth radiates out from its core take on different properties depending on what non-gaseous material they last passed through. If it was more than three feet of water followed by less than three feet of any other solid matter, it will be as if a vampire were standing in direct sunlight. Either sunlight or open water on their own would rob a vampire of all of their advanced powers. Exposure to both at once would further rob them of their strength, leaving them weaker than the average human (and those are the most powerful; to any lesser vampire a combination of sun and open water would be utterly lethal). So no flying across the ocean; they need a ship.\n2: In my setting, magical beings such as vampires cannot under any circumstances stray from human civilization for longer than a month, specifically during the full moon. A phenomenon known as moontime occurs every full moon, and it keeps the supernatural population in check by making any area that's seen excessive immortal foot traffic (more than 1 in 1,000 humans on average over the course of the month) exceedingly lethal for the immortals caught there during the full moon. Being caught out at sea with nobody nearby but the humans on a single ship, therefore, would be a death sentence. So the journey across the sea has to take no more than 30 days.\nI don't expect provisions to be an issue for the voyage. Vampires require a pint of blood every 12 hours they are awake, but can hibernate during daytime and they possess a magical method of preserving human blood in glass bottles, so no need to start draining their crew.\nWith these facts in mind, when is the soonest that human seafaring technology could have allowed a vampire to survive the voyage from Europe to North America?\n"},

The only way to have decreasing energy but constant angular momentum is to have increasing momentum of inertia by\n$$E=\\frac{L^2}{2I}$$\nwhich is clearly not what happens to a pulsar.\nSo should it be the gravitational waves emitted that carries away the angular momentum and slow down the rotation, just like the case of orbital motions slowing down in binary neutron star or blackhole systems?\n"},

But they've struggled to get more than a vague sense of what it was like to have these stimuli.\nThe boy was the narrator, and he spoke of how the two of them would often take turns trying to describe some physical phenomena to the other, attempting to feel what it was like seeing, or feeling the wind on their face etc. I think he said she was better at it than him.\nThat's all I can remember from the book; that, and I got the sense all humans on their ship lived these 'sense-less' lives to save resources.\nI read (the start of) this book as a new paperback sometime between 2011 to 2016 in Dymocks bookstore in Australia, so it was likely published between 2005-2015. It was posssibly YA, given the protagonists' ages. I have a memory of the book having a single-word title with an exclaimation at the end, but I might be mixing it up with another book I saw at the store.\nI've continued to be intrigued by the concept of a society of people who never experience external stimuli other than some 'direct' form of langague (that apparently doesn't involve any sense of hearing).\n"},

As part of my degree, I am required to complete a number of co-ops/internships. These are paid internships in the United States. Students are fully responsible for securing theses positions themselves (searching, applying, interviewing, etc.). It is great experience to have in an early career, but it also means the quality of the positions can vary depending on where you get offers from. I have completed one summer internship and am in the middle of an 8-month internship at a separate company (both software engineering roles).\nWhile these have started out as exciting opportunities to get \"real world\" experience, both internships eventually devolved into mostly unfulfilling work that make me question my career choice as a whole.\nMy biggest grievances with these experiences have been the following:\n\nUnsatisfying workload: The amount of work I have been assigned is often way less than what I am capable of handling.  My managers always praise the pace and quality of my work, but there has simply not been enough to keep me occupied and engaged. Addressing this with comments such as \"I feel like I could be taking on more responsibility\" has not resulted with much change.\nNo collaboration: I have been the sole developer on all of the projects I have been assigned.  While having a high degree of freedom is nice, I feel like it has limited my early career learning and growth.  Not having the opportunity to collaborate with other coworkers or pick the brains of more senior developers has limited me to doing only what I am capable of teaching myself.\nLittle constructive criticism: Being an undergrad student with less than one year of work experience, I fully understand that I have a lot to learn when it comes to my skills as a developer and overall employee.  However, I feel that I don't receive the criticism necessary to make these improvements.  Code reviews have ranged from non-existent to very informal, and directly asking for ways I can improve has not been fruitful.\n\nWhile there have been moments where these internships have felt challenging and rewarding, I'd say the grievances listed above have caused them to feel unfulfilling a majority of the time.  I do enjoy the technical challenge that programming provides, but not enough to justify dealing with these issues.\nAre these just unfortunate experiences that don't reflect the software industry as a whole?  If so, how can I make the most of my time to hopefully secure a better opportunity in the future?\nIf this is actually reflective of life in the software industry, do I need to do some soul searching when it comes to my career path?\n"},

Notably, fortune's favor has material component:\n\na white pearl worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes\n\nNow, I know Caleb had at least one pearl, often used to cast identify (I quote its first use in this answer), but I do not recall Caleb ever buying more pearls or talking about the pearls being consumed for the purpose of casting fortune's favor. Am I remembering that correctly, or did Caleb routinely maintain a stock of pearls that were consumed by castings of fortune's favor, which I have just forgotten about?\nThe reason I ask is that I remember the spell being pretty good - a reroll on anything, attack, check, or save, at the cost of a 2nd level spell slot seems pretty decent, but having just reviewed the spell and noticed the 100 gp consumed component, it now seems like a pretty steep cost for a one-time reroll. I've been using the spell wrong, regarding my recollection of Caleb's use of it as an in vivo play test of the spell having no consumed costly components.\n"}
